**Key Features**:
- IP Proxy rotation.
- Config file support for easy setup.
- CLI support for quick tasks.

## Installation
Install Progzee using pip:

```bash
pip install progzee
```

Usage with proxies passed in constructor:
```python
from progzee import Progzee

# Initialize with proxies explicitly
proxies = ["http://proxy1:port", "http://proxy2:port"]
pz = Progzee(proxies=proxies)

# Make a request
response = pz.get("https://example.com")
print(response.text)
```
Usage with `config.ini`:
```python
from progzee import Progzee

# Initialize with config file
pz = Progzee(config_file="config.ini")
```

CLI Usage:
```java
# Update proxies from a config file
progzee update-proxies --config "config.ini"

# Fetch data from a URL
progzee fetch --url "https://example.com"
```

An example of a `config.ini` file:
```
[progzee]
proxies = http://proxy1:port, http://proxy2:port
timeout_min = 5
timeout_max = 15
```

## Error handling
Progzee automatically retries failed requests with the next proxy in the rotation.

## Validate your proxies
Make sure that you're using valid proxies that you own, or from trusted vendors. One of the trusted vendors you can use is [ProxyScrape](https://proxyscrape.com/?ref=yzczyjq).
